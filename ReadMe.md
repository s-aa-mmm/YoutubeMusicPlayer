# Youtube Music Player 
Made with Python + Tkinter and a couple of other default modules, code is pretty messy since I rushed it

# To Do:
> - [ ] Improve code 
> - [ ] Button to move to certain time on audio of video
> - [ ] Better UI
> - [ ] I'll add more features,  the first 3 are the main focus though
