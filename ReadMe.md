# Youtube Music Player 
Made with Python + Tkinter and a couple of other default modules, code is pretty messy since I rushed it

# To Do:
> - [x] Improve code 
> - [x] Previous/Next song button
> - [ ] Add video info to UI
> - [ ] Load data from previous sessions
> - [ ] Button to move to certain time on audio of video
> - [x] Better UI
> - [ ] I'll add more features,  the first 3 are the main focus though

# Usage:
### Warning: all files must be in the same directory for the music player to work
1. Download [python](https://www.python.org/)
2. Download [VLC-player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.en_GB.html)
3. Download the [repository](https://github.com/s-aa-mmm/YoutubeMusicPlayer)
4. Install modules listed in ['requirements.txt'](https://github.com/s-aa-mmm/YoutubeMusicPlayer/blob/main/requirements.txt)
5. Then from terminal you can do **'python3 MusicPlayer.py'** or you can double click the **'MusicPlayer.py'** [file](https://github.com/s-aa-mmm/YoutubeMusicPlayer/blob/main/MusicPlayer.py)
