# Youtube Music Player 
Made with Python + Tkinter and a couple of other default modules, code is pretty messy since I rushed it

# To Do:
**Basic functionality reached, development of this project will be slowed**
> - [x] Improve code 
> - [x] Previous/Next song button
> - [ ] Key bindings to next, previous, pause, play, etc buttons
> - [ ] Add video info to UI
> - [ ] Load data from previous sessions / + configuration file
> - [ ] Button to move to certain time on audio of video
> - [x] Better UI
> - [ ] I'll add more features,  the first 3 are the main focus though
